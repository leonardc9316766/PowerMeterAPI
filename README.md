# âš¡ PowerMeterAPI

> ðŸ§  Route your API traffic to the cleanest electricity grid in real-time.  
> ðŸš€ Infrastructure just got smarter â€” and quietly cleaner.

## ðŸ§© What It Does

PowerMeterAPI is a **real-time, carbon-aware traffic router**. It dynamically selects the cleanest electricity region (starting with California ISO) for your API requests â€” improving infrastructure efficiency, reducing emissions, and avoiding latency spikes caused by grid congestion.

This is not a report or dashboard. Itâ€™s a live routing layer that actually makes infrastructure decisions smarter, cleaner, and more resilient.

---

## ðŸŒŽ Why It Matters

Most API traffic today is routed based on latency or availability â€” but not **energy cleanliness** or **grid stability**.

- ðŸŸ¢ Clean grids = faster, more stable infrastructure
- ðŸ”´ Dirty grids = legacy risk, latency spikes, hidden cost

By routing traffic based on real-time COâ‚‚ intensity, you unlock smarter infrastructure decisions with no code changes.

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. You send a request to `https://api.powermeterapi.dev/route`
2. The system evaluates real-time carbon intensity (currently for CAISO)
3. It returns the cleanest region for your API to target
4. (Coming soon: Direct proxy routing and multi-cloud auto-routing)

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.powermeterapi.dev/route \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"source_region": "us-west1", "payload_size": 128}'

Response:

{
  "chosen_region": "CAISO",
  "co2_g_per_kwh": 92,
  "total_emissions_g": 11.78,
  "alternatives": [
    { "region": "CAISO", "co2_g_per_kwh": 92 },
    { "region": "BPA", "co2_g_per_kwh": 115 }
  ]
}
